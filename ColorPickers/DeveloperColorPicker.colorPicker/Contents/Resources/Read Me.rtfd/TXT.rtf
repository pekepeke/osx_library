\

\b\fs28 About
\b0 \

\fs24 As you may have guessed, Developer Color Picker (DCP) is a color picker designed for developers. It allows the user to select a color and then copy it as source code suitable for a variety of tasks. DCP supports NSColor, UIColor, CGColorRef, CSS, and HTML style colors.\
\

\b\fs28 Installation
\b0 \

\fs24 Move the "DeveloperColorPicker.colorPicker" file into <home>/Library/ColorPickers. You may have to create the "ColorPickers" folder if it doesn't exist. After installing, you will have to restart any running applications before the color picker will appear in them. The color picker appears in the standard Color Picker window and will be on the far right typically. See the screenshot below.\

I take no responsibility for anything it may do to you or computer. (EG: causing Apple Motion to crash.)

\fs24 \cf0 1.5.2 Color values now match the Apple color pickers. Can now tab between value fields.\
1.5.1 Changed generic HSB support to HSL since that's what CSS actually uses. Doh.\
1.5 Added the ability to change colors via sliders/text fields. Also added hsb(a) support for css style colors.\
